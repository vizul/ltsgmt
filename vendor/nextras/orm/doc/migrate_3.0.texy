BC breaks
=========

The following BC breaks are quite important and you will probably have to deal with them in your code:

- PHP 7.0: this means you have to add newly added typhints to classes that implemnts interfaces from Orm; practically, only typehints in your repositories and mappers will have to be updated;
- Collection: removed comparison operator `!`, use equivalent `!=` operator, e.g. replace `findBy(['name!' => 'Jon'])` with `findBy(['name!=' => 'Jon'])`;
- Entity: all `datetime` properties (types) have to be replaced with `\DateTimeImmutable` type;
- Entity: toArray method was moved from interface, also support constants were moved to support class; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/1f01f75dd5627c25ab8fb745c8b3261bed455849;
- Entity: IEntity::setAsModified() method does not return the entity; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/a7c6d7201d58a615e2ecc0f079f12f9e9344a9c3;
- Entity: IEntity::hasValue() throws an exception when property does not exist; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/a7c6d7201d58a615e2ecc0f079f12f9e9344a9c3;
- Entity: all event methods are included in interface definition, therefore if use override them you will have to chose their visibility modifier to public;
- Entity relationships: removed duplicit relationship names in property modifiers, supported are only these with letter `m`, e.g. `1:m`, `m:1`, `m:m` as abbreviation of Many word; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/1cc1f2464f15d45265bea1cbd5e59001eb8f4b58;
- Mapper: proxy calls from repository have to return already ICollection or IEntity|null. To achieve this, use DbalMapper::toCollection() or DbalMapper::toEntity() methods; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/a7a2744b7a769f472297aa6319d55aceeb0cce81;


The following BC breaks are quite internal, in other words, you probably will not have to do anything because of them:
- Model: refactored internals to use Repository loader. "[commit]": https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/0af0c911a5dddf4f58fc4184f921beff6c393403;
- Entity: removed serilization support, the support was not tested and well covered. Generally speaking, tray to serialize entities' id and refetch it every time you need it;
- Entity: method getRepository throws an exception, when entity is not attached to repository; check the state by IEntity::isAttached() method;
- Entity: virtual properties are never implicitly stored, removed IEntity::SKIP_SET_VALUE; "[commit]": https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/987ca131e7bc2b49dcdb2d7963ed9c221f0f78c7;
- Entity relationships: refactored iterators and collections internals; "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/f4cf22baef87a7ad5232d6d877616e96f1b67d36, "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/eabd333e96b026debc9fe5c63ea9347725638625, "[commit]":https://github.com/nextras/orm/commit/f3a589a4b7e640b94079a5d60dc82ed0920c01fc;
- Entity|Repository: event handling was refactored to own methods, removed fireEvent() methods and replaced with custom methods for each event.
- Repository|Mapper|Model: interface changes
